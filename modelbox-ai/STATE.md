## Repository contents

Sprint prompts, sprint plans and research documents moved out of this
repository on 2026-09-28. Git history is unchanged.

## What v1.11.1 ships

Secure by default, proven against the running appliance: secrets required at
start-up, the first account from `create-owner`, no self-registration in
production, one published port, a declared minimum role on every route with API
keys scoped to their workspace, an audit trail with an appliance owner and
failed writes reported on `/health`, append-only ledgers under a
least-privilege database role, and a gateway that records every provider
request and records failures as fields (v1.11.0). Every API request that writes
commits, or fails, before its response is sent, and the frontend image runs
package install scripts after every package is installed (v1.11.1).

The black-box acceptance suite (`tests/blackbox/`) proves these against the
containers in CI, including a read-your-writes check fifty times over, and
redacts every credential from its reports. The Security FAQ, the Proof Log and
the acceptance register state what those tests prove.

Notes: `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.1.md`, `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.0.md`
(superseded). Index: `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Published-image verification

`.github/workflows/verify-release.yml` runs the black-box suite against the
images a release published, pulled on a runner that never built them, after
every successful release and on demand. It is dispatched for v1.11.1 once this
branch is on `main`; the result is in that workflow's run history.
